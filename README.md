# openresty-njs
OpenResty with NJS bundled

The purpose of this project is to create a platform that uses OpenResty as the core and ads nginx NJS as additional functionality, so both Lua and JavaScript programming languages can be used to develop HTTP route handlers.

```shell
chmod +x ./build-from-sources.sh
sudo ./build-from-sources.sh
```

Get some patience, it takes some time ...
